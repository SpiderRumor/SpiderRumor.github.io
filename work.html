		<div class="title">WNYU</div>
		<div class="chapterDesc">As Technology Director at WNYU I worked with the design firm Awesome Possum to herald in the ground up redesign of WNYU's web services. In addition to moving the station forward, I maintained and administrated the disparate network of infrastructure, a frankenstein monster that was slowly iterated upon over the greater part of a decade. </div>

				A large part of the redesign required the generation of new art assets to promote and extend the brands of the shows on the station. This involved working with the DJs themself along with the DJ's content to develop individual identities based on original material ranging from small snippets of personality during ad breaks, to more involved podcasts personalities coming through podcasts.

				During my time at WNYU I held down a weekly 2-hour radio show called New New York 3k. This show highlighted niche electronic music with a focus on exploring internet scenes and liminal music genres such as Muzak and more avant stuff. The show ended with a station-first 24-hour long radio stream which I promoted through print and trailer.

		<div class="title">Guillo: The Smart Guillotine</div>
		<div class="chapterDesc">As the capstone project for Integrated Digital Media I developed Guillo, a fictional tech startup hoping to make waves by creating "solutions" and "answers". The product itself was a piece o' junk pile of wood in the shape of a guillotine with a smart phone attached to it. The only victim of this guillotine? subtlety</div>

				Part of recreating a modern tech company involved coming up with the appropriate marketing and display materials. This included graphs and posters to be able to try and deliver the spirit of the product quickly.

				Of course, no tech thing would be complete without their own very professional Bootstrap website. Including all of the hyped standards of the time <a href="http://guillo.website">guillo.website</a> presents all of the rhythms and language that would make it seem like a good thing, even though it is, at best, mediocre.

</div>
				The whole undertaking required making a sort of "Brand Bible" for a fictional brand. The end result was a style of speaking, and a clear image that was trainable and easily reproducible. Me and drafted other students at the showcase were able to make startlingly similar demos based on the strength of the core messaging of this product.

				<div class="media"><img src="portImages/lstream.png"></div>
				Based on <a href="https://toplap.org/live-coding-youtube/">Live Coding Youtube</a> I adapted the piece. The performance loads up a combination of youtube videos and twitch.tv livestreams, then plays them over each other becoming a improvisational noise piece about whatever's going on at that moment online. Then I begin to stream out the performance to twitch.tv, then insert my own stream into the performance, investigating redundancy and analog/digital noise of the endeavour.

				Like many others who have grown up on the ol 'net I've been producing weird jokes and content for all of the social media for as long as I have been able. Look at this! Proficiency in a great deal of mediums! "Wow, how hirable is this guy?" I hear you think.

				I have been published for poetry in the school publication West 10th, along with the (very probably vanity published) "New York's Best Emerging Poets" which you probably should not buy.<br />For the student publication Lorem Ipsum I published an article exploring the larger repercussions of algorithmic streaming services on culture. I'll link it once they get their URLs in order.
