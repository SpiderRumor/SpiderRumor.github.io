		<span id="leading">In</span> the summer of 2017 I lived in a small apartment in Dyker Heights without air conditioning. I would wake up in a puddle of my own fluids, slop over to the other side of the room, slouch down and watch the television show "Frasier". Eventually I grew curious. I needed to know which one of the Frasiers I would be. Would I be the irrascible Eddie (the dog)? The elusive and abusive Maris? Or the big man himself: Frasier Crane? I did not have an answer. BuzzFeed, the website designed for these purposes gave no respite. I had to design my own solution.
