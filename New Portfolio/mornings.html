		<span id="leading">Mornings.</span> Such a sweet seductive mystery they are. Never before has an idea of a region of time been so disassociated with one's geographic area. Well no more. Finally a tool to combine and reveal the places where it is morning (if it is morning) and also the places where it is not morning (if it is not morning).
