		<span id="leading">The</span> final performance of my WNYU radio show was a 24 hour long show with an accompanying, brief, promotion period. This included making a poster and a video. The show itself attempted to be a death rattle of New New York 3000, encompassing the ethos of the show through experimentation, along with having it's own individual "storylines". The resulting archive was too large to fit on the stations servers and might still live on one of those computers to this day.
