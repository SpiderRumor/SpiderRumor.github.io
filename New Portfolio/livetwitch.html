		<span id="leading">LiveTwitching</span> was an extension of Sang Won Lee's <a href src="https://livecodingyoutube.github.io/"> LiveCoding Youtube </a> that allowed it to work with live Twitch.tv stream. The idea being, in performance, to layer real life livestreams of people playing videogames into a cacophonous barely meditated noise, which I then fed through various compressors and effects to just make it sound awful. The performance ends when the headphone jack is pulled from the laptop.
